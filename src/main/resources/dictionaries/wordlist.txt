NO

IVE
FORGOTTEN
EVERY

THE

ITS
WHY
I
ALWAYS
CARRY
TELE
STRAPS
EXTRA
SNACKS
A
LEATHERMAN
TOOL
AND
A
COUPLE
BEERS
IN
MY

ITS
WHY
I
ALWAYS
BRING
AN
EXTRA
DOZEN
BAGELS
AND
CREAM
CHEESE
TO
THE
HILL
EACH
MORNING
TO
SHARE
WITH
FRIENDS
ITS
WHY
I
USUALLY
KEEP
AN
EXTRA
PAIR
OF
SKIS
POLES
AND
A
SHOTZSKI
IN
ROOF
BOX
ON
MY
CAR
AND
ITS
WHY
WHEN
A
FREAK
SEPTEMBER
STORM
DROPPED
BETWEEN
612
OF
SNOW
ON
THE
WASATCH
THIS
PAST
WEEKEND
I
WAS
MORE
THAN
READY
TO
GET
IN
MY
FIRST
TWO
APRÈSSKI
DAYS
OF
THE
SEASON
THE
STORM
ROLLED
IN
LAST
THURSDAY
NIGHT
CAUSING
ACCIDENTS
ON
THE
ROADS
SOME
FLOODING
A
TORNADO
IN
OGDEN
AND
WORST
OF
ALL
THE
CANCELLING
THE
TETON
GRAVITY
RESEARCH
PREMIERE
IN
SALT
LAKE
CITY
BUT
BY
MIDNIGHT
THE
HEAVY
RAINS
HAD
TURNED
TO
SNOW
IN
THE
HIGHER
ELEVATIONS
I
WENT
TO
BED
WATCHING
THE
SNOWFALL
FIGURES
START
TO
BUILD
IN
THE
UPPER
COTTONWOODS
A
FEW
HOURS
OF
SLEEP
AND
A
TWO
CUPS
OF
COFFEE
FROM
PARK
CITY
BREAD
AND
BAGEL
LATER
I
WAS
ON
MY
WAY
TO
THE
TOP
OF
GUARDSMAN
PASS
TO
CHECK
OUT
THE
FRESH
SNOW
COVERING
THE
FALL
COLORS
WHILE
LEAF
PEEPING
I
MADE
SURE
TO
KEEP
AN
EYE
OUT
FOR
SPOTS
WHERE
WITH
A
FEW
MORE
INCHES
OF
SNOW
I
COULD
MAYBE
SNEAK
IN
MY
FIRSTEVER
SEPTEMBER
TURNS
THE
ONLY
MONTH
ID
NEVER
PREVIOUSLY
APRÈSSKIED
I
HATE
TO
ADMIT
IT
BUT
I
WASNT
THE
FIRST
ONE
TO
SKI
OR
APRÈSSKI
IN
UTAH
THIS
SEASON
WHILE
DRIVING
AROUND
BIG
COTTONWOOD
CANYON
I
SAW
A
FEW
GUYS
WITH
GEAR
HEADED
UP
TO
SKI
SOME
BUSHES
BACK
AT
WORK
I
SAW
SOME
FRIENDS
HAD POSTED
PHOTOS
OF
TURNS IN
THE
UINTAS
THEN
CELEBRATING
WITH
A
VERY
FITTING
PBR
I
WAS
ENVIOUS
OF
THOSE
TURNS
AND
THAT
BEER
AND
I
KNEW
WHAT
HAD
TO
BE
DONE
A
COUPLE
OF
HOURS
LATER
MY
BUDDY
KYLE
AND
I
WERE
BACK
AT
THE
TOP
OF
GUARDSMAN
PASS
WITH
SKI
GEAR
A
COUPLE
OF
BEERS
AND
A
GOPRO
THIS
WAS
THE
RESULT
ILL
BE
THE
FIRST
CONFESS
THAT
IVE
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
HAM
IT
UP
A
TIME
OR
TWO
FOR
A
GOOD
INSTAGRAM
BUT
THE
PHOTO
I
POSTED
THIS
TIME
WASNT
AT
ALL
INDICATIVE
OF
THE
ACTUAL
SKIING
THAT
TOOK
PLACE
THAT
DAY
I
STARTED
TO
FEEL
A
LITTLE
GUILTY
AS
WE
ENJOYED
OUR
FIRSTAPRÈSSKI
SESSION
OF
THE
SEASON
AT
NO
NAME
SALOON
I
WOKE
UP
FEELING
WORSE
AND
DECIDED
TO
PUT
TOGETHER
A
VIDEO
SHOWING
THE
REALITY
OF
OUR
GLORIFIED
SKI

I
MADE
SURE
TO
KEEP
AN
EYE
ON
THE
GROWING
SNOWFALL
TOTALS
IN
LITTLE
COTTONWOOD
CANYON
AFTER
SEEING
SOME
VIDEOS
OF
PEOPLE
MAKING
REAL
TURNS
THAT
MORNING
I
WRANGLED
TOGETHER
A
POSSE
AND
WE
SET
OFF
TO
ALTA
TO
SEE
IF
WE
COULDNT
ATONE
FOR
OUR
FIRST
SKI
DAY
WE
ARRIVED
AT
ALTA
AND
WERE
PLEASANTLY
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
SNOW
AND
CARS
IN
THE
PARKING
LOT
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAD
THE
SAME
IDEA
WE
DID
A
LITTLE
WAYS
UP
THE
HILL
A
CREW
WAS
SESSIONING
A
LITTLE
BOOTER
AS
A
COUPLE
PEOPLE
PICKED
THEIR
WAY
THROUGH
THE
ROCKS
ON
CORKSCREW
IT
LOOKED
THIN
BUT
WE
WERE
GOING
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SKI
WE
GEARED
UP
AND
STARTED
SKINNING
ADMIRING
THE
FALL
FOLIAGE
POWDERED
WITH
SEPTEMBER
SNOW
ALONG
THE
WAY
WE
STOPPED
TO
WATCH
SOME
LOCAL
SKIERS
AND
PHOTOGRAPHER
ROCKO
MENZYK CAPTURE
SOME
OF
THE
FIRST
BACKFLIPS
OF
THE
SEASON
ON
A
LITTLE
BOOTER
KEVIN
ASKED
TO
HIT
THE
JUMP
AND
THREW
HIS
FIRST
360
OF
THE
SEASON
A
PRETTY
GOOD
SIGN
THAT
THE
DAY
AND
THE
SEASON
WERE
OFF
TO
A
GOOD
START
WE
DIDNT
HAVE
ANY
IDEA
WHAT
WE
WERE
GOING
TO
SKI
SO
WE
JUST
KEPT
SKINNING
AND
SURVEYING
THE
OPTIONS
WE
PAST
UP
SOME
GREAT
LOOKING
LINES
AND
MADE
A
NOTE
TO
FIND
THEM
ON
THE
WAY
DOWN
AS
WE
NEARED
THE
TOP
OF
COLLINS
LIFT
THE
FOG
CLEARED
AND
WE
COULDNT
HELP
BUT
STOP
AND
STARE
AT
MAIN
CHUTE
AND
WHAT
LOOKED
LIKE
SKI
TRACKS
COMING
OUT
OF
THE
BOTTOM
IT
LOOKED
MARGINALLY
RIDEABLE
HMMM
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
FULL
DISCLOSURE
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
THAT
SKIING
MAIN
CHUTE
ON
SEPTEMBER
24TH
WASNT
A
LAST
SECOND
IDEA
AS
WE
WERE
SKINNING
A
WEEK
BEFORE
THE
STORM
HIT
WHEN
POWDERHOUND
MATT
SENT
OUT
A
GROUP
TEXT
ABOUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
WINTER
STORM
HITTING
THE
WASATCH
I
MENTALLY
RAN
THROUGH
THE
OPTIONS
FOR
PRESEASON
TURNS
SEEING
AS
HOW
MY
20152016
SEASON
ENDED
WITH
A
RUN
DOWN
MAIN
CHUTE
ON
JUNE
20TH
I
WAS
NATURALLY
DRAWN
TO
THE
IDEA
OF
STARTING
MY
SEASON
ON
THE
SAME
LINE
JUST
THREE
MONTHS
LATER
I
CALLED
UP
MY
BUDDY
JOE
JOHNSON
WHO
HAD
SKIED
IT
LAST
PRESEASON
WITH
SIMILAR
COVERAGE
FOR
SOME
INTEL
THIS
IS
MY
BEST
RECAP
OF
THE
CONVERSATION
HONESTLY
I
FORGOT
WE
DID
THAT
I
THINK
IT
WAS
SO
BAD
I
BLOCKED
IT
OUT
OF
MY
MEMORY
THE
ENTRANCE
IS
SHARKY
THE
MIDDLE
FILLS
IN
AND
SKIS
PRETTY
WELL
THE
BOTTOM
IS
A
MINEFIELD
OF
BOULDERS
AS
LONG
AS
YOURE
OK
WITH
SURVIVAL
SKIING
THE
TOP
AND
WALKING
OUT
OF
THERE
IT
COULD
BE
DONE
YOURE
NOT
SERIOUS
ARE
YOU
I
WASNT
100
SERIOUS
JUST
MAKING
SURE
I
FOLLOWED
MY
ONE
TAKEAWAY
FROM
TEN
YEARS
OF
BOY
SCOUTS
BE
PREPARED
STANDING
IN
COLLINS
GULCH
AND
LOOKING
UP
AT
MAIN
CHUTE
OUR
GROUP
DELIBERATED
FOR
A
FEW
MINUTES
KYLE
HAD
DINNER
PLANS
WITH
HIS
GIRLFRIEND
AND
MADE
A
RESPECTABLE
YET
HECKLED
DECISION
TO
BAIL
KEVIN
WHO
WAS
ALSO
HAD
DINNER
PLANS
WITH
HIS
PARENTS
KNEW
HIS
DAD
WOULD
BE
MORE
UPSET
IF
HE
DIDNT
TRY
TO
SKI
IT
ZACH
WAS
HESITANT
BUT
CONFIDENT
AND
SAID
HE
COULD
GO
EITHER
WAY
I
KNEW
THAT
HE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
SKI
AN
ICONIC
LINE
GOBIGGETBABES
IN
SEPTEMBER
WAS
TOO
GOOD
TO
PASS
UP
I
MADE
THE
CALL
TO
GO
FOR
IT
OR
AT
LEAST
SEE
HOW
WE
FEEL
WHEN
WE
GET
UP
THERE
WHICH
REALLY
MEANS
I
DONT
WANT
TO
JINX
IT
BUT
WERE
GOING
FOR
IT
THE
HIKE
FROM
EBT
TO
BALDY
WAS
A
LITTLE
DICEY
WITH
NO
VISIBILITY
AND
WITHOUT
A
BOOTPACK
UP
THE
RIDGELINE
WE
HAD
TO
NEGOTIATE
SOME
ICY
ROCKS
AS
WE
BLINDLY
MADE
OUR
WAY
UP
THE
RIDGE
WE
THEN
POSTHOLED
OUR
WAY
UP
TOWARDS
THE
TOP
OF
MOUNT
BALDY
STOKED
THAT
THE
SNOW
WAS
DEEPER
THAN
EXPECTED
BUT
ALSO
EXHAUSTED
FROM
THE
THREE
HOURS
OF
HIKING
AND
SKINNING
BEHIND
US
WE
FOUND
THE
TOP
OF
MAIN
CHUTE
AROUND
6PM
WHILE
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NICE
TO
WAIT
FOR
BETTER
VISIBILITY
WE
WERE
RUNNING
OUT
OF
TIME
WE
TOOK
A
COUPLE
CLICHÉ
LOOKINGDOWNMAIN
CHUTE
PICS
AND
DROPPED
IN
THE
SKIING
WAS
EXACTLY
HOW
JOE
HAD
DESCRIBED
IT
SURVIVAL
SKIING
TO
GET
INTO
THE
CHUTE
BETTER
THAN
EXPECTED
POWDER
TURNS
THROUGH
THE
MIDDLE
SUPER
THIN
COVERAGE
AT
THE
EXIT
WHICH
DROPPED
US
INTO
AN
UNSKIABLE
MINEFIELD
STANDING
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
MAIN
CHUTE
WE
DIDNT
CARE
ABOUT
THE
CORE
SHOTS
BEHIND
US
OR
AWAITING
US
ON
THE
WAY
DOWN
WE
WERE
ELATED
TO
HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED
OUR
GOAL
OF
EXPERIENCING
SEPTEMBER
POWDER
TURNS
IN
MAIN
CHUTE
WE
TRAVERSED
AS
FAR
AS
WE
COULD
OUT
OF
THE
BALLROOM
THEN
SKIED
TOWARDS
THE
LINES
WE
HAD
PASSED
ON
THE
WAY
UP
FEELING
INVINCIBLE
WE
DODGED
ROCKS
AND
HOPPED
OVER
BUSHES
MANAGING
TO
FIND
SOME
GREAT
SNOW
ON
THE
WAY
DOWN
IT
GOT
THIN
AS
WE
APPROACHED
THE
BASE
BUT
WE
FOUND
SOME
LINES
THAT
CONNECTED
EVEN
STOPPING
TO
HIT
THE
LITTLE
BOOTER
ON
THE
WAY
TO
THE
CAR
WE
HIGHFIVED
TOOK
A
CELEBRATORY
SHOT

WE
RECOUNTED
OUR
SKI

AND
WATCHED

SNOWBOARD
SEASON
BEST
DAYS
THIS
WEATHER
DISCUSSION
AND
SEASON
OUTLOOK
IS
PROVIDED
BY
OUR
FRIENDS
AT
WASATCH
SNOW
FORECAST 
UTAH
IS
COMING
OFF
ITS
FIRST
WIDESPREAD
SNOWFALL
OF
THE
SEASON
A
RATHER
SIGNIFICANT
EARLY
SEASON
STORM
WHICH
BROUGHT
COPIOUS
PRECIPITATION
TO
THE
STATE
ABOVE
8000
FEET
SNOW
ACCUMULATED
IN
EARNEST
WITH
612
IN
THE
WASATCH
RANGE
AND
UP
TO
15
IN
THE
UINTA
MOUNTAINS 
WITH
WARM
TEMPERATURES
EXPECTED
THIS
WEEK
ITS
UNLIKELY
THAT
THE
SNOW
WILL
LAST
LONG 
STILL
THE
RETURN
OF
WINTER
WEATHER
GOT
ME
THINKING 
WHAT
IF
ANY
CORRELATION
DO
EARLY
SEASON
STORMS
HAVE
ON
HOW
THE
WINTER
PLAYS
OUT
WITH
REGARD
TO
TOTAL
SEASONAL
SNOWFALL 
I
COULDNT
JUST
LET
THIS
QUESTION
SIT
UNANSWERED
SO
I
DECIDED
TO
HAVE
A
LOOK 
INITIALLY
I
WANTED
TO
LOOK
AT
OTHER
PREVIOUS
STORMS
IN
SEPTEMBER
BUT
FOUND
THAT
SIGNIFICANT
PRECIPITATION
EVENTS
ARE
RARE
AND
THEREFORE
MY
DATASETS
WERE
TOO
SMALL
TO
DETERMINE
A
CORRELATION
I
DECIDED
TO
USE
OCTOBER
AS
OUR
KEY
INDICATOR
INSTEAD 
DOES
AN
ACTIVE
OCTOBER
CORRELATE
TO
A
BETTER
WINTER
OVERALL
IN
EACH
OF
THE
PAST
TWO
YEARS
2014
AND
2015
WE
SAW
VERY
LITTLE
SNOWFALL
DURING
OCTOBER 
THE
WASATCH
CREST
TRAIL
WAS
RIDEABLE
UP
TO
THE
END
OF
THE
MONTH
IN
EACH
YEAR 
WHEN
YOU
THINK
OF
OCTOBER
SNOWFALLS
PERHAPS
THE
FIRST
THING
THAT
COMES
TO
MIND
IS
OCTOBER
2004 
IF
YOU
REMEMBER
IT
YOU
PROBABLY
REMEMBER
UNREAL
AMOUNTS
OF
POWDER
ON
HALLOWEEN
BRIGHTON
OPENED
ON
OCTOBER
29
 ALTA
HAD
122
INCHES
OF
SNOW
DURING
THE
MONTH 
IT
WAS
UNLIKE
ANYTHING
WE
HAD
SEEN
BEFORE
OR
SINCE 
JUST
HOW
GOOD
WAS
THAT
OCTOBER
2004
PUT
IT
THIS
WAY
ON
HALLOWEEN
OF
THAT
YEAR
WE
HAD
108
OF
SNOW
WATER
EQUIVALENT
SWE
AT
THE
SNOWBIRD SNOTEL
SITE 
OVER
OUR
PAST
FIVE
WINTERS
20112016
WEVE
FAILED
TO
REACH
THAT
AMOUNT
OF
SWE
UNTIL
MUCH
LATER
IN
THE
SEASON 
THE
BLACK
LINE
IN
THE
ABOVE
IMAGE
INDICATES
THAT
108
OF
SWE 
ITS
TAKEN
US
UNTIL
AT
LEAST
THE
FIRST
WEEK
OF
DECEMBER
TO
REACH
THAT
POINT
OVER
THE
PAST
5
YEARS 
IN
ONE
CASE
2012
WE
DIDNT
MATCH
OCTOBER
31
2004S
BASE
UNTIL
THE
THIRD
WEEK
OF
JANUARY 
BUT
HOW
DID
THAT
SEASON
20042005
TURN
OUT
AFTER
OUR
GREAT
START
PRETTY
DARN
WELL 
ALTA
RECEIVED
553
FROM
NOVEMBER
2004
THRU
APRIL
2005 
THE
SNOWPACK
ON
APRIL
1ST
2005
WAS
AT
160
OF
NORMAL 
OF
COURSE
THIS
IS
ONLY
ONE
EXAMPLE 
I
WANTED
TO
GET
A
LARGER
DATA
SET
TO
COMPARE 
SNOTEL
DATA
AT
SNOWBIRD
IS
AVAILABLE
BACK
TO
THE
198990
SEASON 
THAT
GIVES
ME
27
YEARS
OF
DATA
TO
PLAY
WITH 
I
GRABBED
THE
TOTAL
ACCUMULATED
PRECIPITATION
IN
EACH
OCTOBER
TO
DETERMINE
HOW
ACTIVE
THE
MONTH
WAS 
THEN
I
CORRELATED
THAT
TO
HOW
DEEP
OUR
SNOWPACK
WAS
ON
APRIL
1ST
OF
EACH
OF
THE
RESPECTIVE
FOLLOWING
SKI
SEASONS 
THEN
I
PUT
THAT
INTO
A
SCATTER
PLOT
THAT
WOULD
MAP
OUT
THE
CORRELATION 
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
FOUND
EACH
DOT
REPRESENTS
A
WINTER
SEASON 
THE
XAXIS
IS
HOW
MUCH
PRECIPITATION
SNOWBIRD
RECEIVED
DURING
OCTOBER
LEADING
INTO
THAT
SEASON 
THE
YAXIS
IS
THE
TOTAL
SNOW
WATER
EQUIVALENT
SWE
ON
APRIL
1ST
OF
THAT
SEASON 
THE
TOP
5
MOST
ACTIVE
OCTOBERS
ARE
INDICATED
WITH
BLUE
DOTS 
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
PREVIOUSLY
MENTIONED
OCTOBER
2004
AS
THE
FARTHEST
DOT
TO
THE
RIGHT
ON
THE
CHART 
YOU
CAN
ALSO
SEE
THAT
IT
HAS
THE
HIGHEST
SWE
ON
APRIL
1 
FOUR
OF
THE
FIVE
MOST
ACTIVE
OCTOBERS
ENDED
WITH
A
SNOWPACK
WELL
ABOVE
THE
MEAN
BLACK
LINE  
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
COIN
THE
FIVE
DRIEST
OCTOBERS
ARE
INDICATED
WITH
RED
DOTS 
YOU
CAN
SEE
THAT
OUR
WORST
SNOWFALL
SEASON
20142015
IS
INCLUDED
IN
THESE
DRIEST
OCTOBERS 
HOWEVER
THREE
OF
THE
FIVE
DRIEST
OCTOBERS
ACTUALLY
ENDED
UP
ABOVE
THE
MEAN
SWE
ON
APRIL
1
ALBEIT
MARGINALLY 
OVERALL
THE
ENDOFSEASON
MEAN
SWE
FOR
DRY
OCTOBERS
IS
ONLY
05
BELOW
THE
OVERALL
MEAN
THIS
EQUATES
TO
ROUGHLY
6
INCHES
OF
SNOWFALL 
THE
MEAN
FOR
THE
ACTIVE
OCTOBERS
IS
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
THE
OVERALL
MEAN
BY
113
OF
LIQUID 
THIS
IS
ROUGHLY
1215
FEET
OF
SNOW 
WHAT
DOES
ALL
THIS
MEAN
IN
THE
GRAND
SCHEME
OF
THINGS
IT
MEANS
THAT
THERE
IS
A
FAIRLY
STRONG
POSITIVE
CORRELATION
RED
LINE
IN
GRAPH
ABOVE
BETWEEN
HOW
ACTIVE
OCTOBER
IS
AND
HOW
GOOD
OUR
SKI
SEASON
IS 
IT
ALSO
MEANS
THAT
EVEN
IF
WE
HAVE
A
DRY
OCTOBER
THAT
DOESNT
NECESSARILY
MEAN
WE
ARE
DOOMED
TO
HAVE
A
BAD
SEASON 
A
VERY
WET
AND
ACTIVE
OCTOBER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
MAKES
IT
HIGHLY
LIKELY
THAT
OUR
OVERALL
SNOWFALL
TOTALS
FOR
THE
SEASON
WILL
BE
ABOVE
NORMAL 
OF
COURSE
LONG
RANGE
FORECAST
MODELS
ARE
JUST
NOW
STARTING
TO
COME
INTO
RANGE
OF
THE
FIRST
WEEK
OF
OCTOBER 
THERES
REALLY
NO
TELLING
JUST
WHAT
OUR
OCTOBER
WILL
BRING
THIS
YEAR
BUT
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
HAD
ONE
SIGNIFICANT
STORM
AND
EARLY
INDICATIONS
ARE
THAT
WE
COULD
HAVE
AN
ACTIVE
START
TO
OCTOBER
2016 
IF
WE
SEE
ANYTHING
CLOSE
TO
WHAT
WE
SAW
IN
OCTOBER
2004
IT
MIGHT
MEAN
MOUTHWATERING

FOR
THE
REST

FIRST
I
WANT
TO

WHY

A
GOOD
IDEA
ON
MANY
FRONTS
WHY
RIDE
THE

BECAUSE
IT

EVERYONE
LIKES
TO
TALK
ABOUT
HOW POWDER
MOUNTAIN IS
UTAHS
BEST
KEPT
SECRET
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
ABSOLUTELY
LOVE
POW
MOW
BUT
IN
MY
OPINION
THE
AWARD
FOR
BEST
KEPT
SECRET
HAS
TO
GO
TO BEAVER
MOUNTAIN THIS
PLACE
IS
SO
FAR
OFF
THE
RADAR
THAT
NO
ONE
EVEN
BOTHERS
TO
SHOW
UP
ON
A
TEN
INCH
POWDER
DAY
IN
MARCH
WE
ARRIVED
AT
AROUND
930
AM
TO
AN
ALMOST
EMPTY
PARKING
LOT
ACTUALLY
I
LIE
THERE
WERE
18
CARS
IN
THE
LOT
DONT
BELIEVE
ME
CHECK
OUT
THE
PHOTO
SURE
YOU
CAN
SAY
IT
WAS
A
MONDAY
BUT
THIS
IS
JUST
RIDICULOUS
THIS
IS NOW
THE
SECOND
TIME
IVE
BEEN
UP
THERE
BOTH
HAVE
BEEN
ON
DOUBLE
DIGIT
POWDER
DAYS
AND
BOTH
TIMES
THE
PLACE
HAS
BEEN
A
GHOST
TOWN
THE
PHOTO
BELOW
WAS
TAKEN
AT
2
PM 
THE
LAST
TIME
I
SKIED
THE
BEAV
IT
WAS
AN
IDENTICAL
EXPERIENCE
IF
YOURE
LOOKING
TO
GO
INTO
A
TIME
WARP
AND
SKI
UNTRACKED
POWDER
LITERALLY
ALL
DAY
LONG
JUST
HEAD
TO
BEAVER
THE
NEXT
TIME
THERE
IS
A
STORM
ON
THE
HORIZON 
SURE
YOU
CAN
SPEND
HUNDREDS
OR
EVEN
THOUSANDS
OF
DOLLARS 
AND
GO
CAT
OR
HELI
SKIING
TO
SKI
UNTRACKED
POW
OR
YOU
CAN
SPEND
$48
AND
JUST
LAP
THE
BEAV
FOR
HOURS
ON
END

IMPRESSED
WITH
THE
TEACHERS
WHO
WERE
FUN
AND
KIND
AND
ENCOURAGING
ON
A
REALLY
SLOW
DAY
THE
LIFT
OPERATORS
COULD
HAVE
EASILY
BEEN
BORED
BUT
INSTEAD
WERE
VERY
FRIENDLY
HELPFUL
AND
HAPPY
IN
FACT
MY
FIRSTTIME
SNOWBOARDER
GOT
A
CHEER
FROM
THE
LIFT
OPERATOR
WHEN
HE
GOT
OFF
THE
LIFT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
WITHOUT
FALLING
I
COULD
TELL
THE
SNOW
WAS
NOT
GREAT
BUT
WE
ARE
NOT
SNOW
SNOBS
AND
IT
DIDNT
AFFECT
OUR
DAY
IM
NOT
SURE
WITH
THE
WARM
WEATHER
LATELY
THAT
ANY
RESORT
HAS
GREAT
SNOW
RIGHT
NOW
THE
PRICE
WAS
AMAZING
AND
TOTALLY
DOABLE
FOR
A
BIGGER
FAMILY
TO
TRY
SKIING
WE
WILL
BE
BACK
I
TOOK
THE
KIDS
SKIING
FOR
THE
FIRST

IT
WAS
LATER
IN

VERY
FEW

WERE
THERE
AT

WE
HAD
THE
WHOLE
PLACE
TO
OURSELVES
I
ENROLLED
THE
4
